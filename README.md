# zkTLS-Att-Verification

## Introduction
This Repository provides functionality for verifying ECDSA signature and AES ciphertext against attestations generated by `Primus`. For ECDSA signature, the underlying elliptic curve is Secp256k1. The AES ciphertext is outputed using AES-128-GCM.

## Compile

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Example
There is an example `examples/verification_example.rs`, demostrating how to verify aes ciphertext. Build the example and run as following:
```bash
cargo build --release --example verification_example
./target/release/examples/verification_example
```

Another example is `examples/attestation_example.rs`, demostrating how to verify attestations generated by `Primus`. It will verify ecdsa signature, aes ciphertext and the data source url of the attestation. Build the example and run as following:
```bash
cargo build --release --example attestation_example
./target/release/examples/attestation_example
```

## Benchmark
The benchmark file is located in `bench`. Build the bench program and run as following:
```bash
cargo bench --bench benchmark
```
